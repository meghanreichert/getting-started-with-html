  <h1>Meghan's Notes for HTML Basics Lesson 1</h1>
  <b>The Internet</b>
  <p>The World Wide Web is the largest computer network in the world. The web works as a series of four component parts.
  <br>You, your computer/browser, the Internet itself, and the servers all make up what is collectively known as the Internet.
  <br>Your browser is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. Servers are computers that
  <br>host these files. Your browser makes a request to these servers using HTTP, the main protocol of the web.

  This video </a> explains this well.

  <b> HTML </b>
  <p>HTML is an acronym for "Hypertext markup language." HTML code is the basis for almost every page on the web.
  <br>HTML consists of the text content of the page, the markup for that text, references to other documents, and links to
  <br>other pages on the web. HTML is coded using elements. HTML tags are a type of element that defines the format/display 
  <br>of the content of that page. </p>
  <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
  <p>HTML elements can be either inline of block. Block elements create an invisible box around a body of text. The break
  <br> tag is an inline element, while the paragraph tag is a block element.</p>
  <b>Note on Coding</b>
  <p>Because computers do not think like we do, tiny mistakes in code, like not forgetting a closing tag, become big mistakes
  <br>for computers. Although a mistake may seem insignificant to us, it can yield an entire section of code meaningless to a 
  <br>computer.
